# Quiz App

This is a small quiz app which I created for the purpose of helping me try out different frontend technologies. 

I wrote the baseline version as quickly as possible using only plain JavaScript, HTML & CSS, neither aiming to make it intentionally bad, nor putting much thought into structuring and optimizing my code.
My goal was to provide myself with a small, simple app which I can use to learn and try out different frontend technologies, so I'll be adding branches with refactored versions of the same app using new technologies.

The app uses questions provided by https://opentdb.com/.
